# Helicopter3D
 OpenGL Legacy

### Ideas for future implementations
- [ ] Lighting
- [x] Fire when firing the missile
- [ ] Ammo available on the ground that refills the helicopter by pressing a key (Note: helicopter must obviously be on the ground)
- [ ] Scenario and setting
- [ ] More realistic motion animations (movement and animations of propellers and missiles)
- [ ] Cause the helicopter to explode if the blades are turned off in mid-air (crashing animation is cool)
- [ ] Make the code more organized, separating it into libraries
- [ ] Change of matching textures
